Need music for the three acts: in themes


the year's path: Haven
white and magic: Maybe Infiltration, but it feels too random.
an invisible sword: NONE, way too random
a path and matrices:NONE
the yellow journeys: Haven, or end of escape, once the haven is reached again. Really feels like an ending song. Maybe even "credits"
a dock and a village:Happy endingish
broken ages: escape, maybe at fast parts of infiltration, more agressive. (may be too random)
broken sisters: way better than broken ages, good for escape or infiltration
on the ocean's gorillas: relaxed tension. could go anywhere. 
an elf and years: relaxed.
the white garden: agressive but too random, probably.
